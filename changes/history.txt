0.3 (08-10-2009)
================

 * Added `svndjango.sven.DjangoAutoupdatingSvnAccess` class
   (depends on sven>=0.4) which will deserialize Django model
   objects out of your committed documents and save them to
   your Django database after the commit goes through.

   Assumes you will have your Django environment and settings
   properly installed at checkin-time, and assumes that all
   checkins should be saved to the Django database.

   If these conditions are met, use as a drop-in replacement
   for `sven.backend.SvnAccess` (see that package's documentation
   for usage)

0.2 (07-30-2009)
================

 * Declare sample SubversionedModel as an abstract base class so django won't create
   a pointless database table for it.

0.1 (07-24-2009)
================

Initial release.
